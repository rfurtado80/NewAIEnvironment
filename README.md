This repository contains a simple script for modifying Excel files.

## Usage

The `copy_column.py` script copies the contents of column **B** to column **C** in the specified Excel file and saves the result to the same directory with `_modified` appended to the filename.

Run the script with Python and follow the prompt to provide the Excel file path:

```bash
python copy_column.py
```

The modified file will be saved in the same directory as the original.
